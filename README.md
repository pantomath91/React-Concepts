## Helpful Hints

### VSCode

The best editor for JS / TS projects is currently VSCode. It is a free and lightweight editor. If you have never tried it, take time to download it and play with it.

* Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/
* From within the editor, install the extensions/plugins:
  * TSLint - TSLint for Visual Studio Code
  * EditorConfig for VSCode - EditorConfig Support for Visual Studio Code

### React Chrome DevTools

The React Chrome Dev Tools Extension can be very useful to see the React component tree live in the browser
